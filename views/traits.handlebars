<p><b>Activate</b> An action with this trait is used as part of the Activate an Item activity.</p>
<p><b>Additive</b> Alchemists use additives. Feats with this trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances to bombs or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically take actions with the additive trait only when you’re creating an infused alchemical item, and some can be used only with the Quick Alchemy action.</p>
<p><b>Agile</b> The multiple attack penalty you take on the second attack each turn with this weapon is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.</p>

<p><b>Alchemical</b> Alchemical items are powered by reactions of alchemical reagents, sometimes sparked by the user’s Resonance Points. Alchemical items aren’t magical, and they don’t radiate a magical aura. Characters can Craft these items only if they have the Alchemical Crafting feat.</p>
<p><b>Alchemist</b> This indicates abilities from the alchemist class.</p>
<p><b>Animal</b> An animal is a creature with a relatively low Intelligence. They typically do not have an Intelligence ability score over 3, can’t speak languages, and can’t be trained in Intelligence-based skills.</p>

<p><b>Archetype</b> This feat belongs to an archetype.</p>
<p><b>Attached</b> An attached weapon must be combined with another piece of gear in order to be used. The trait lists what type of item the weapon must be attached to. You must be wielding or wearing the item the weapon is attached to in order to attack with it. For example, shield spikes are attached to a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes instead of a shield bash, but only if you’re wielding the shield. An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it’s attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be removed from one item and attached to another with successful use of the Crafting skill. If an item is destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.</p>
<p><b>Attack</b> This ability grants an attack. For each attack you make beyond the first on your turn, you take a multiple attack penalty.</p>
<p><b>Auditory</b> Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can’t hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect makes sound.</p>
<p><b>Backstabber</b> When you hit a flat-footed creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage. The damage increases to 2 if the weapon is master quality or to 3 if it’s legendary.</p>

<p><b>Chaotic</b> Chaotic effects often manipulate energy from chaos-aligned Outer Planes and are anathema to lawful divine servants or divine servants of lawful deities.

<p><b>Consecration</b> A consecration spell enhances an area for an extended period of time. A given area can have only a single consecration effect at a time. The new consecration effect attempts to dispel the old one.</p>
<p><b>Consumable</b> An item with this trait can be used only once. Unless stated otherwise, the item is destroyed after activation, though in some cases, part of it might be recoverable for other purposes. For instance, while a potion is a consumable item, the vial the potion comes in is not destroyed after the potion is activated. When a character creates consumable items, she can make them in batches of four, as described in the Craft activity.</p>
<p><b>Contact</b> This poison activates on touch.</p>
<p><b>Curse</b> A curse is an effect that places some long-term affliction on a creature. Curses are always magic and are typically the result of a spell or trap.</p>
<p><b>Darkness</b> Darkness effects extinguish light in the area, including less powerful magical light. Darkness and light effects can negate one another.</p>
<p><b>Deadly</b> On a critical hit, a weapon with this trait adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. This damage increases to two dice if the weapon is master quality and three dice if the weapon is legendary. For instance, a master-quality rapier deals 2d6 additional piercing damage on a critical hit.</p>
<p><b>Death</b> A death effect kills living creatures more easily.</p>
<p><b>Dedication</b> You must select a feat with this trait to start following an archetype.</p>
<p><b>Detection</b> Effects with this trait attempt to determine the presence or location of a person, thing, or aura. Most effects with the detection trait also have the divination trait.</p>
<p><b>Dinosaur</b> These reptiles have survived from prehistoric times.</p>
<p><b>Disarm</b> You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as a bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to treat it as a normal failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.</p>

<p><b>Enchantment</b> Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the enchantment school of magic, typically involving mind control, emotional alteration, and other mental effects.</p>
<p><b>Evil</b> Evil effects often manipulate energy from evil-aligned Outer Planes and are anathema to good divine servants or divine servants of good deities. A creature with this trait is evil in alignment. An ability with this trait can be selected or used by evil creatures only.</p>
<p><b>Evocation</b> Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the evocation school of magic, typically involving energy and other elemental forces.</p>

<p><b>Fear</b> Fear effects evoke the emotion of fear. Effects with this trait always have the mental and emotion traits as well.</p>
<p><b>Fighter</b> This indicates abilities from the fighter class.</p>
<p><b>Finesse</b> You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier when making attack rolls with this melee weapon. You still use Strength when calculating damage.</p>

<p><b>Force</b> Effects with this trait deal force damage or create objects made of pure magical force.</p>
<p><b>Forceful</b> This weapon becomes more dangerous when you build up momentum. When you attack with the weapon more than once on your turn, the second attack adds a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent attack adds a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.</p>
<p><b>Fortune</b> Effects that improve your destiny or luck have the fortune trait. They usually change the results of your dice rolls. Fortune and misfortune cancel each other out.</p>
<p><b>Fragile</b> If fragile armor takes a Dent, it’s automatically broken.</p>
<p><b>Free-Hand</b> This weapon doesn’t take up your hand, usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand weapon can’t be Disarmed. You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so forth. You can’t attack with a free-hand weapon if you’re wielding anything in that hand or using the hand for something else. When you’re not wielding anything and not using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand.

<p><b>Healing</b> A healing effect restores a creature’s body in some way, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing other debilitating effects.</p>
<p><b>Heritage</b> Ancestry feats that have the heritage trait are feats that your character can select only at 1st level. Unlike with other feats, you cannot retrain your character to learn a heritage feat or to change her existing heritage feat at any point. Your character can never have more than one heritage feat.</p>
<p><b>Human</b> A creature with this trait is one of the humans, a diverse array of people known for their adaptability. An ability with this trait can be used or chosen only by humans.</p>
<p><b>Humanoid</b> Humanoid creatures reason and act much like humans. They typically stand upright and have two arms and two legs.</p>
<p><b>Illusion</b> Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the illusion school of magic, typically involving false or magically altered sensory stimuli.</p>
<p><b>Infused</b> An alchemical item with the infused trait doesn’t cost its crafter any Resonance Points to activate (whether using Operate Activation or any other relevant action), though anyone else must spend Resonance Points to activate it normally. An infused item is potent for only 24 hours, after which it becomes inert. Alchemists create infused items.</p>
<p><b>Ingested</b> This poison activates when consumed.</p>
<p><b>Inhaled</b> This poison activates when inhaled.</p>
<p><b>Injury</b> This poison activates on a damaging Strike.</p>
<p><b>Invested</b> An item that a character needs to prepare by investing it with a Resonance Point has the invested trait. Most invested items are worn, like armor, clothing, or jewelry. None of the magical effects of the item apply if the character hasn’t invested it, though the character still gains any normal benefits from the physical item (like a hat keeping rain off a character’s head).</p>
<p><b>Lawful</b> Lawful effects often manipulate energy from law-aligned Outer Planes and are anathema to chaotic divine servants or divine servants of chaotic deities. A creature with this trait is lawful in alignment. An ability with this trait can be selected or used by lawful creatures only.</p>
<p><b>Leaf Order</b> This gives druids of the leaf order an extra benefit.</p>
<p><b>Light</b> Light effects generate light. Darkness and light effects can negate one another.</p>
<p><b>Lingual</b> A lingual effect depends on language comprehension. A lingual effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using. Effects with the lingual trait are also likely to have the auditory trait.</p>
<p><b>Litany</b> Litanies are special champion powers, typically used by paladins and requiring a single action. Usually a creature you target with a litany becomes bolstered against all of your litanies.</p>
<p><b>Magical</b> Magical items are imbued with magical energies. Each one radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic (abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or transmutation). A character can craft these items only if she has the Magical Crafting feat. Some items are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicates that the item is magical.</p>
<p><b>Manipulate</b> You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use this type of action. Creatures without a suitable appendage cannot perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.</p>
<p><b>Mechanical</b> A hazard with this trait—typically a trap—is a constructed physical object.</p>
<p><b>Mental</b> Mental spells affect the target’s mind. They have no effect on mindless creatures or objects. Mental can also appear as a damage type for spells that deal damage through psychic trauma.</p>
<p><b>Metamagic</b> Metamagic feats trigger when you begin casting a spell and typically require you to spend an additional spellcasting action to alter the spell’s effects. You can’t use metamagic feats if adding an action to the spell would make the spell require more actions than you have remaining on your turn. Because most metamagic feats have the same trigger, you usually can’t use more than one metamagic feat per spell.</p>
<p><b>Mindless</b> A mindless creature has either programmed or rudimentary mental attributes. Most, if not all, of their mental ability scores are 1. They are immune to all mental effects.</p>
<p><b>Minion</b> A creature with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn and can’t use reactions. A minion acts on your turn in combat when you spend an action to issue it verbal commands (this action has the concentrate trait). If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for at least 1 minute, mindless minions don’t act, whereas intelligent ones act as they please.</p>
<p><b>Misfortune</b> The misfortune trait appears on spells that cause you ill fortune. They usually change the results of your dice rolls. Fortune and misfortune can cancel each other out.</p>
<p><b>Monk</b> This indicates abilities from the monk class. If this trait appears on a weapon, monks can use that weapon with their abilities that normally require unarmed attacks.</p>
<p><b>Morph</b> Spells that slightly alter a creature’s form have the morph trait. You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the first morph effect is immediately dismissed. Your morph effects can also be dismissed if you are polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. For instance, a morph that sharpened your fingers into claws would be dismissed if you polymorphed into a form that lacked hands, and a morph that gave you wings would be dismissed if you polymorphed into a form that had wings of its own (however, if your new form lacked wings, you’d keep the wings from your morph). The GM determines which morph and polymorph effects can be used together and which can’t.</p>
<p><b>Move</b> This action involves moving from one space to another in some way. Attacks of Opportunity and other reactions are triggered when a creature within a certain distance of the reactor moves from one space to another.</p>
<p><b>Multiclass</b> Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying your training into another class’s specialties. You can’t select a multiclass archetype’s dedication feat if you are a member of the class of the same name.</p>
<p><b>Mutagen</b> The alchemical elixirs called mutagens change the imbiber’s mental and physical characteristics.</p>
<p><b>Necromancy</b> These effects and magic items are associated with the necromancy school of magic, typically involving life and death.</p>
<p><b>Negative</b> Effects with this trait heal undead creatures with negative energy, deal negative damage to living creatures, or manipulate negative energy.</p>
<p><b>Noisy</b> This armor’s check penalty to Stealth checks increases by 1.</p>
<p><b>Nonlethal</b> All attacks made with this weapon are nonlethal and are used to knock creatures unconscious instead of killing them.</p>
<p><b>Oath</b> Feats with the oath trait always add an additional tenet to the paladin’s code, and a paladin can usually have only one such feat.</p>
<p><b>Occult</b> This spell or magic item comes from an occult spellcaster or from the occult magical tradition.</p>
<p><b>Oil</b> An oil is a liquid magic item applied to the surface of an item or creature.</p>
<p><b>Open</b> You can use an action with the open trait only if you haven’t used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.</p>
<p><b>Orc</b> A creature with this trait is one of the orcs, green-skinned people with a reputation as warmongers. Orcs tend to have darkvision. An ability with this trait can be used or chosen only by orcs (including half-orcs). A weapon with this trait is created and used by orcs and half-orcs.</p>
<p><b>Paladin</b> This indicates abilities from the paladin class.</p>
<p><b>Parry</b> This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, you can spend an action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p><b>Plant</b> Vegetable creatures have the plant trait. They are distinct from normal plants. Magical effects with this trait manipulate or conjure plants or plant matter in some way. Those that manipulate plants have no effect in a dead area with no plants.</p>
<p><b>Poison</b> These effects deliver a poison or deal poison damage. An item with the poison trait is poisonous and might cause an affliction.</p>
<p><b>Polymorph</b> These effects transform the target into a new form. Neither a creature nor an object can be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If a creature or object comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect dispels the first one. Unless otherwise stated, spells with the polymorph trait don’t allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.</p>
<p><b>Positive</b> Effects with this trait heal living creatures with positive energy, deal positive energy damage to undead, or manipulate positive energy.</p>
<p><b>Possession</b> Effects with this trait allow a creature to project its mind and spirit into a target. A creature immune to mental effects can’t use a possession effect. While possessing a target, a possessor’s true body is unconscious (and can’t wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that much damage as mental damage. A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities, though it gains the benefits of the target’s active spells and abilities. A possessor can use any of the target’s abilities that are purely physical, and it can’t use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target’s attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, and spell DC; this includes any invested items where applicable (the possessor’s invested items apply when using its own values, and the target’s invested items apply when using the target’s values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster since it isn’t in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions and reactions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it becomes dying as normal and the possession ends immediately. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can choose to either go unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the possession ends immediately and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.</p>
<p><b>Potent</b> When a character Invests an Item with this trait, the item improves one of that character’s ability scores, either increasing it to 18 or increasing it by 2, whichever grants the higher ability score. A potent item grants this benefit only the first time it’s invested within a 24-hour period, and a character can benefit from only one potent item at a time.</p>
<p><b>Potion</b> A creature activates and consumes these magical liquids by drinking them as an Operate Activation.</p>
<p><b>Prediction</b> Effects with this trait determine what is likely to happen in the near future. Most predictions are divinations.</p>
<p><b>Press</b> An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. Effects on a failure can be gained only if the action took a –4 multiple attack penalty or worse. The effects that are added on a failure don’t apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds or critically succeeds but deals no damage and causes no other effects (typically due to resistance), you can apply the failure effect instead.</p>
<p><b>Prestige</b> Archetypes with the prestige trait represent the pinnacle of power and ability in a narrow field of expertise. You can never have more than one prestige archetype dedication feat.</p>
<p><b>Primal</b> This spell or magic item comes from the untamed forces of nature, from a primal spellcaster, or from the primal magical tradition.</p>
<p><b>Propulsive</b> You add half your Strength modifier to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon so long as your Strength modifier is not negative. If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full Strength modifier instead.</p>
<p><b>Rage</b> You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging. Barbarians can Rage.</p>
<p><b>Ranger</b> This indicates abilities from the ranger class.</p>
<p><b>Reach</b> This weapon is long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.</p>
<p><b>Revelation</b> Effects with this trait see things as they truly are. Most revelations are divinations.</p>
<p><b>Rogue</b> This indicates abilities from the rogue class.</p>
<p><b>Scroll</b> A spell can be written on a piece of parchment called a scroll to be cast later.</p>
<p><b>Scrying</b> A scrying effect lets you see, hear, or otherwise get sensory information from a distance from a sensor or apparatus, rather than your own eyes and ears.</p>
<p><b>Secret</b> This trait indicates that the GM rolls the check for this ability in secret.</p>
<p><b>Shadow</b> Magic with this trait manipulates or depends on shadows or the energy of the Shadow Plane.</p>
<p><b>Shove</b> You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as a bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to treat the outcome as a normal failure.</p>
<p><b>Skill</b> A feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their uses or gives you new uses for a skill.</p>
<p><b>Snare</b> Traps typically made by rangers, snares follow special rules that allow them to be constructed quickly and used on the battlefield.</p>
<p><b>Sonic</b> An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum. This is different than an auditory spell, which is effective only if the target can hear it. A sonic effect might deal sonic damage.</p>
<p><b>Sorcerer</b> This indicates abilities from the sorcerer class.</p>
<p><b>Special</b> A material with the special trait is harder to find or work than normal. They can be substituted for base materials when you are constructing items.</p>
<p><b>Spellcasting</b> This action is used as part of the Cast a Spell activity.</p>
<p><b>Splash</b> When a character uses a thrown weapon with the splash trait (such as an alchemical bomb or holy water), she doesn’t add her Strength modifier to the damage roll. A splash weapon can deal splash damage in addition to its normal damage. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target take the indicated amount of splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of the attack also takes the splash damage. Splash damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
<p><b>Staff</b> This magic item holds spells of a particular theme. A spellcaster who has invested a staff can expend their own spells or charges held in the staff to cast the spells.</p>
<p><b>Stance</b> A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait. You can enter a stance only in encounter mode. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first.</p>
<p><b>Storm Order</b> This gives druids of the storm order an extra benefit.</p>
<p><b>Summoned</b> A creature called by way of a conjuration spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can’t summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require an expensive material component or special focus. It can use only 2 actions on its turn, and it can’t use reactions. It takes its actions when you finish Casting the Spell and when you spend an action to Concentrate on a Spell. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells and effects and are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the spell that calls them is dismissed.</p>
<p><b>Sweep</b> This weapon makes wide-sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted an attack this turn against a creature other than the target of this attack.</p>
<p><b>Teleportation</b> Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another. Teleportation does not usually trigger reactions based on movement.</p>
<p><b>Thrown</b> You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range in feet. Ranged weapons with this trait can be thrown at a range equal to the weapon’s specified range.</p>
<p><b>Totem</b> Abilities with the totem trait require a specific totem, and you lose access to them temporarily when you perform actions that are anathema to your totem. Barbarian characters choose totems.</p>
<p><b>Transmutation</b> Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically involving changing the qualities or form of one thing into another.</p>
<p><b>Trap</b> A hazard or item with this trait is purposefully placed or constructed to hinder interlopers.</p>
<p><b>Trinket</b> The consumable magic items called trinkets must be affixed to items before they can be activated. Most require the user to have a special feat or skill to Activate them.</p>
<p><b>Trip</b> You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as a bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to treat the outcome as a normal failure.</p>
<p><b>Twin</b> These weapons are used as a pair, each complementing the other. When you are wielding two of the same weapon with this trait and attack with one of them, if you already attacked with the other weapon this turn, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon’s number of damage dice. For instance, if you attacked with a twin weapon in your right hand with your first action, you would gain this bonus to damage when you attack with a matching twin weapon in your left hand for your second action. On your third action, an attack with either weapon would receive this bonus, since you’d already attacked with both. The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don’t need to be the same quality or have the same runes.</p>
<p><b>Two-Hand</b> This weapon can be wielded with two hands. This increases its weapon damage die to the indicated value. If this trait applies to a magic weapon , the extra weapon damage dice from it being a magic weapon also increases to the indicated damage die while it’s being wielded with two hands.</p>
<p><b>Unarmed</b> An unarmed attack is made using your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn’t a weapon, though it’s categorized with weapons for weapon tables and weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Because it’s a part of your body, an unarmed attack can’t be Disarmed. It also doesn’t take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon.</p>
<p><b>Undead</b> Once living, these creatures were infused after death with negative energy and soul-corrupting evil magic. When reduced to 0 Hit Points, an undead creature is destroyed. Undead creatures are damaged by positive energy, are healed by negative energy, and don’t benefit from healing effects.</p>
<p><b>Versatile</b> A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than the type listed in the damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that has versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.</p>
<p><b>Virulent</b> This affliction is harder to remove.</p>
<p><b>Visual</b> A visual spell can affect only creatures that can see it.</p>
<p><b>Volley</b> This ranged weapon is less effective at close distances. Your attacks take a –2 penalty against targets that are at a distance within the number of feet listed.</p>
<p><b>Wand</b> A wand is a stick or similar object containing a spell that can be cast a certain number of times.</p>
<p><b>Water</b> Effects with the water trait either manipulate or conjure water. Those that manipulate water have no effect in an area without water. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of water or have a magical connection to the element.</p>
<p><b>Wild Order</b> This gives druids of the wild order an extra benefit.</p>
<p><b>Wizard</b> This indicates abilities from the wizard class.</p>
