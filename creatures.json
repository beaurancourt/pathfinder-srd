The wrath demon can choose to delay the dance to allow up to three additional wrath demons within 30 feet to join in; in that case, the explosion occurs after the last wrath demon uses Dance of Ruin or one of the dancers chooses to unleash the effects of the dance. When the dance is completed, all nondemon creatures in a 20-foot aura of any of the dancers take 2d12 electricity damage (Reflex DC 23 half, double damage on a critical failure, no damage on a critical success). For each additional wrath demon that joins, the damage increases by 1d12 and the DC of the save increases by 1 (to a maximum of 5d12 damage and a DC 27 save with four wrath demons). The wrath demons can continue dancing for up to two additional rounds by using Dance of Ruin on consecutive rounds, increasing the aura by 20 feet each round and the damage by an additional 1d12 per wrath demon each round (to a maximum of four wrath demons dealing 13d12 damage on the third round)."

The vines can be destroyed if the creature is affected by a good spell or if holy water is applied to the vines with an Interact action.
